Determining honesty
assuming comments are not trustworthy
detect promises from comments from official sources, news articles and social media posts released during campaign
compare promises with voting records after the campaign
should show both number and proportion of broken promises on website

Approach to labeling
find speeches about a submitted vote
label speeches with vote

Bucket list creation
popular topics across the political spectrum
equally spaced on the spectrum
consistent for everyone

Political compass evaluation
two axis: political (horizontal) and hierarchical (vertical)
coordinates on the political spectrum determined based on voting history
coordinates on the hierarchical spectrum is harder to determine. One method is use NLP to determine whether they
prefer a more liberal or authoritarian approach to enforcing their worldview
in addition: economic spectrum (horizontal)
determined based on specific voting history (economic policies)

## New Pipeline proposal
For each politician:
    Public speeches >
    claim detection >
        train with ??? or MARPOR corpus dataset
    Disclosure network analysis >
        manually add the polarity (agreement or rejection of claim), identify the actor (in the case of manifestos,
        this is always the party), filter the false positives from the automatically identified suggestions, and
        categorize the remaining claims according to the codebook
    or claim classification >
        train with MARPOR corpus dataset
    claim-based embedding for the individual

    Voting history >
    vote-based embedding for the individual

# Note
claim and vote based embeddings should be symmetrical (same structure and format)
they should maximise amount of info preserved (avoid dimensionality reduction)
need to define a metric to measure the difference between two embeddings
    linear vs exponential (many small differences == or > or < few large differences)
    scale each topic-wise difference by topic popularity
    5 point scale from theyvoteforyou vs binary scale from MARPOR
