Determining honesty
assuming comments are not trustworthy
detect promises from comments from official sources, news articles and social media posts released during campaign
compare promises with voting records after the campaign
should show both number and proportion of broken promises on website

Approach to labeling
find speeches about a submitted vote
label speeches with vote

Bucket list creation
popular topics across the political spectrum
equally spaced on the spectrum
consistent for everyone

Political compass evaluation
two axis: political (horizontal) and hierarchical (vertical)
coordinates on the political spectrum determined based on voting history
coordinates on the hierarchical spectrum is harder to determine. One method is use NLP to determine whether they
prefer a more liberal or authoritarian approach to enforcing their worldview
in addition: economic spectrum (horizontal)
determined based on specific voting history (economic policies)
